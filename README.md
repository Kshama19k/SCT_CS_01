# 🔐 Caesar Cipher Cybersecurity App

This is a simple console-based Python application that allows users to **encrypt** and **decrypt** messages using the **Caesar Cipher** algorithm — a classic encryption technique used in cryptography.

## 🚀 Features

- Encrypt text using Caesar Cipher
- Decrypt text using Caesar Cipher
- Supports both uppercase and lowercase characters
- Ignores and retains punctuation, digits, and whitespace
- Command-line based user interaction

---

## 🛠️ How It Works

The Caesar Cipher works by shifting the position of each letter in the message by a fixed number of places in the alphabet.

For example, with a shift of `3`:  
`A` → `D`, `B` → `E`, ..., `Z` → `C`

Decryption simply reverses the process.
